| Grade | Name | Count | Importance | Examples |
|-------|------|-------|-----------|----------|
| A | 甲級星 | 14 | CRITICAL | Ziwei, Tianjl, Sun, Wuqu, Tiantong, Lianzhen, Tianfu, Taiyin, Tanlang, Jumen, Tianxiang, Tianliang, Qisha, Pojun |
| B | 乙級星 | 30 | HIGH | Hong Luan, Tian Xi, Xunkong, Jiekong, Tai Fu, Feng Gao, Tiankui, Tianyue, Tianyao, etc. |
| C | 丙級星 | 60 | MEDIUM | 12 Phases of Longevity, 12 Scholar-Generals, Tianshang, Tianshi |

## Four Great Voids System (四大虛星)

### Overview
The Four Great Voids represent emptiness, loss, and dissipation in destiny. Two were researched in detail:

| Void Star | Characteristic | Nature | Mechanic |
|-----------|---|---|---|
| 地空 | Earthly void | Permanent | Ground-level emptiness |
| 天空 | Heavenly void | Permanent | Celestial-level emptiness |
| 旬空 | Cyclic void | Temporary | Time-based (大運/流年) |
| 截空 | Interception void | Permanent | Cut off/blocked ("Black hole") |

### Common Mechanic: Reverse Effects
```
"見吉化凶，見凶化吉"
Auspicious stars → Becomes inauspicious
Malevolent stars → Becomes mitigated/less harmful
```

This reverse mechanism makes void stars exceptionally important for chart interpretation.

## Key Insights & Recommendations

### 1. Combination Effects Trump Individual Stars
The analysis reveals that **combination effects are more powerful than individual stars**:
- Hong Luan ALONE is good
- Tian Xi ALONE is good
- Hong Luan + Tian Xi TOGETHER = Strongest romantic indicator in entire system

**Implementation:** Always analyze star combinations, not isolated stars.

### 2. Void Stars Require Reverse Thinking
Void stars (旬空, 截空) operate with **opposite logic** from other stars:
- Don't assume voids are always bad
- Voids with malefic stars can **reduce harm**
- This dual nature makes them critically important

**Implementation:** Special handling in chart algorithm needed.

### 3. Modern vs. Traditional Interpretation
Some stars (like 封誥 Feng Gao) require **translation to contemporary context**:
- Traditional: Official ranks and imperial honors
- Modern: Corporate recognition, job titles, social status

**Implementation:** Provide both interpretations in platform.

### 4. Star Grade B Effects Vary by Context
- In **natal chart:** Subtle, supporting role
- In **luck cycles (大運/流年):** Significant influence
- Some research texts emphasize luck cycle effects heavily

**Implementation:** Context-aware analysis (chart vs. luck cycles).

### 5. Research Gaps Exist for Lesser-Known Stars
- 月照 (Yuezhao) - limited English documentation
- 天梟 (Tianjiao) - sparse in English sources
- Both require deeper dive into Chinese authoritative sources

**Recommendation:** Prioritize development using sources identified in ZIWEI_KNOWLEDGE_GAPS.md:
- Zhihu (Wang Ting Zhi teachings)
- Weread (Complete books)
- Scribd (Advanced lectures)

---

## Priority Integration Recommendations

### Tier 1 - Implement First (HIGH Impact):
1. **紅鸞天喜 (Hong Luan + Tian Xi)** - Most frequently referenced, highest romance accuracy
2. **旬空 (Xunkong)** - One of Four Voids, significant fortune impact
3. **截空 (Jiekong)** - One of Four Voids, reverse mechanic critical

### Tier 2 - Implement Second (MEDIUM Impact):
4. **台輔 (Tai Fu)** - Career/status indicator
5. **封誥 (Feng Gao)** - Recognition/promotion indicator
6. **台輔封誥 (Combination)** - Complete status analysis

### Tier 3 - Implement Third (Research Needed):
7. **月照 (Yuezhao)** - Requires additional research
8. **天梟 (Tianjiao)** - Requires deeper dive into authoritative sources
