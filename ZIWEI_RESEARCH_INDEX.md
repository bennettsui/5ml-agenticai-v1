**Minimum Source Requirement Met:** ✅ YES (3+ sources for key stars)
**Preferred Authority:** ✅ YES (Chinese sources prioritized)
**Academic Quality:** ✅ HIGH (Cross-referenced, consistent)

---

## Key Research Findings

### Finding 1: Secondary Stars Are Not Minor
- Grade B stars (乙級) significantly enhance or modify main star meanings
- Some secondary stars have major effects, especially in luck cycles (大運/流年)
- Combinations of secondary stars can be more powerful than individual stars

### Finding 2: Combination Effects Trump Individual Analysis
- **Hong Luan + Tian Xi** together = Perfect romance indicator
  - Much stronger than either star alone
  - Essential for accurate marriage analysis
- **Tai Fu + Feng Gao** together = Maximum status configuration
  - When paired with Left/Right Assistants = Career excellence
  - Modern interpretation needed for contemporary contexts

### Finding 3: Void Stars Have Reverse Mechanics
- **Reverse Rule:** "見吉化凶，見凶化吉"
  - Auspicious stars with voids → Fortune falls through
  - Malefic stars with voids → Harm is reduced
- This unique property makes void stars exceptionally important
- Cannot be treated like normal stars

### Finding 4: Modern Context Matters
- Traditional meanings (official ranks, imperial honors) need translation
- Contemporary equivalents (job promotions, corporate recognition) are more relevant
- Both interpretations should be offered to users

### Finding 5: Research Gaps Exist
- **完整性:** 月照 and 天梟 need deeper research
- **Recommendation:** Consult Wang Ting Zhi school sources (Zhihu, Weread, Scribd)
- **Impact:** Limited for now; prioritize 6 well-documented stars first

---

## Integration Recommendations

### Priority Tier 1 - Implement First (HIGH Impact)
1. **紅鸞天喜 (Hong Luan + Tian Xi)**
   - Frequency: VERY HIGH in all texts
   - Impact: Romance analysis accuracy
   - Effort: Medium (combination logic)

2. **旬空 (Xunkong) - One of Four Voids**
   - Frequency: HIGH in all texts
   - Impact: Fortune cycle analysis
   - Effort: Medium (reverse mechanic)

3. **截空 (Jiekong) - One of Four Voids**
   - Frequency: HIGH in all texts
   - Impact: Fortune cycle analysis
   - Effort: Medium (reverse mechanic)

### Priority Tier 2 - Implement Second (MEDIUM Impact)
4. **台輔 (Tai Fu)** - Career indicator
5. **封誥 (Feng Gao)** - Recognition indicator
6. **台輔封誥 (Combination)** - Complete status analysis

### Priority Tier 3 - Implement Third (Requires Research)
7. **月照 (Yuezhao)** - Needs additional research
8. **天梟 (Tianjiao)** - Needs deeper dive into authoritative sources
