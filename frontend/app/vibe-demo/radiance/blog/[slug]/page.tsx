    title: 'Why Earned Media Should Be at the Heart of Your PR Strategy',
    date: '18 Feb 2026',
    category: 'Public Relations',
    readTime: '5 min read',
    excerpt: 'Earned media—coverage that you don\'t pay for, earned through genuine relationships and compelling stories—carries credibility that paid content cannot match.',
    content: `
      <section>
        <h2>What is Earned Media?</h2>
        <p>Earned media is coverage you receive from third-party publications, broadcasters and platforms without paying for advertising. It's a journalist writing about your product, a news outlet reporting on your initiative, or an influencer sharing their authentic experience with your brand.</p>
        <p>The "earned" part is crucial. You've earned this coverage through compelling stories, genuine relationships with journalists and substantive value that's worth covering.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Why Earned Media Matters More Than Ever</h2>
        <p>In an age of ad blockers, algorithmic feeds and audience scepticism toward branded content, earned media stands out for one simple reason: credibility.</p>
        <p>When a consumer sees an advertisement, they understand it's paid. When they read a journalist's article about your product or brand, they perceive it as independent validation. That difference in perception translates directly into trust and influence.</p>
        <p>Studies consistently show that earned media coverage influences purchasing decisions more than any other marketing channel. It's not because the content is better written—it's because a third party has vouched for you.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Earned Media vs Other Channels</h2>
        <p><strong>Paid advertising:</strong> You control the message entirely, but audiences know they're being sold to. ROI is measurable but often requires constant spending to maintain visibility.</p>
        <p><strong>Owned media (your website, social channels):</strong> You own the audience relationship and can speak directly, but reach is limited to people already following you. Building an audience takes time.</p>
        <p><strong>Earned media:</strong> You don't control the message (the journalist does), but the credibility is unmatched. A single feature can reach hundreds of thousands of people. The challenge is earning that coverage consistently.</p>
        <p>The most effective strategies integrate all three, but earned media should be the foundation.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Building Your Earned Media Strategy</h2>
        <p>Here's how to make earned media central to your PR approach:</p>
        <p><strong>1. Build genuine relationships with journalists</strong> Don't just pitch when you have news. Follow journalists' work, engage thoughtfully with their reporting, and reach out with valuable information or perspectives even when it doesn't directly benefit you.</p>
        <p><strong>2. Tell stories, not features</strong> Journalists don't care that your product has five ingredients. They care about the problem it solves, the people it helps, or the trend it represents. Lead with the human angle.</p>
        <p><strong>3. Be a reliable source</strong> Offer expert commentary, data and insights that journalists can use across multiple stories, not just your own. Over time, you become the go-to source for your industry.</p>
        <p><strong>4. Create newsworthy moments</strong> Think strategically about how to tie your work to current events, seasonal trends, research findings or policy developments that journalists are already covering.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
        <p>Earned media requires patience, relationship-building and a genuine commitment to telling stories that matter—not just to your business, but to your audience and journalists.</p>
        <p>But the payoff is substantial: credibility that no amount of advertising can buy, reach that scales beyond your owned channels, and influence that shapes how your industry and market perceive your brand.</p>
        <p>Make it central to your PR strategy, and watch how it transforms your brand's visibility and authority.</p>

    title: 'The Power of Integrated Campaigns: When PR, Events and Social Actually Work Together',
    date: '15 Feb 2026',
    category: 'Strategy',
    readTime: '7 min read',
    excerpt: 'Most campaigns fail because PR, events and social media operate in silos. Learn how integrated campaigns amplify every channel.',
    content: `
      <section>
        <h2>The Silo Problem</h2>
        <p>Many organisations treat PR, events, and social media as separate functions managed by different teams with different budgets and goals. PR focuses on media coverage, events handle attendee experience, and social media... well, they're trying to drive engagement on the platform.</p>
        <p>These functions rarely talk to each other. And when they don't, the result is wasted opportunity.</p>
        <p>A product launch becomes four disconnected initiatives: a press release, a launch event, a social media campaign and maybe an influencer partnership. Each runs on its own timeline with its own strategy. Some elements reinforce each other by accident; others actively compete for attention and budget.</p>
        <p>Integrated campaigns solve this by designing all elements around one central narrative and timeline.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>What Makes a Campaign Integrated</h2>
        <p><strong>One narrative:</strong> All channels tell the same core story, adapted for their audience. PR emphasises the news hook, events create the experience, social media amplifies the moment.</p>
        <p><strong>Coordinated timing:</strong> Everything doesn't happen at once, but nothing happens in isolation either. The event becomes the centrepiece, with PR building anticipation beforehand and social media extending reach afterward.</p>
        <p><strong>Shared goals:</strong> Beyond "increase awareness," all channels aim for the same business outcome: sales, signups, behaviour change, or community building.</p>
        <p><strong>Cross-channel content:</strong> Assets created for one channel are repurposed across others. Event footage becomes social content. Media coverage is shared and amplified. Social moments become PR angles.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Real-World Example: Product Launch</h2>
        <p>Here's how an integrated approach transforms a product launch:</p>
        <p><strong>Pre-launch (3-4 weeks before):</strong> PR begins building anticipation with teaser stories and exclusive early access for key journalists. Social media starts seeding curiosity with sneak peeks and behind-the-scenes content. Event team finalises logistics.</p>
        <p><strong>Launch week:</strong> The event is the centrepiece. Media attends. Influencers document. Customers experience it first-hand. Photography and video capture every moment.</p>
        <p><strong>Post-launch (1-2 weeks after):</strong> PR secures follow-up coverage from event highlights and customer reactions. Social media shares event content, customer testimonials and user-generated posts. Event team gathers customer feedback for ongoing marketing.</p>
        <p><strong>Ongoing:</strong> All touchpoints direct audiences toward the same conversion goal (buy, sign up, learn more).</p>
        <p>The result? Each channel amplifies the others. Media coverage drives social discussion. Social conversation prompts more media coverage. Event attendees become brand advocates across their networks.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>How to Build Integrated Campaigns</h2>
        <p><strong>1. Start with strategy, not channels</strong> Define your goal, target audience, core message and timeline. Only then decide which channels to use and how.</p>
        <p><strong>2. Assign an integration lead</strong> One person or team should oversee the full campaign, ensuring alignment across PR, events, social and any other channels involved.</p>
        <p><strong>3. Plan backwards from the centrepiece</strong> Identify your central moment (launch event, campaign milestone, big announcement). Build everything else around it.</p>
        <p><strong>4. Create a shared content calendar</strong> All teams work from one calendar showing PR timing, event dates, social posts and content launches. Conflicts and gaps become obvious.</p>
        <p><strong>5. Design for content multiplication</strong> Every piece of content should feed other channels. A photo from the event becomes social content and a media asset. A journalist's question becomes a social post. A customer testimonial becomes PR follow-up.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Measuring Integrated Campaigns</h2>
        <p>Track metrics across all channels to understand the full impact:</p>
        <p>Media coverage (reach, tone, message pull-through), event attendance and sentiment, social engagement and reach, traffic and conversions, and overall business impact.</p>
        <p>Look for amplification: Did social conversation spike around PR coverage? Did event attendance increase after social teasing? Did press coverage drive web traffic? These connections prove integration is working.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
        <p>Integrated campaigns require more planning, more coordination and more communication than siloed approaches. But they deliver exponentially more impact.</p>
        <p>When PR, events and social media work together, each channel becomes more powerful. That's the magic of integration.</p>

    date: '12 Feb 2026',
    category: 'Product Launch',
    readTime: '6 min read',
    excerpt: 'Hong Kong\'s media landscape has unique dynamics. Discover the key steps for securing meaningful coverage and building awareness for new product launches.',
    content: `
      <section>
        <h2>The 9-Step Product Launch Event Playbook</h2>
        <p>Product launches in Hong Kong require a strategic approach that accounts for the territory's unique media landscape, consumer behaviour and competitive dynamics. Here's a battle-tested playbook that drives both media coverage and market awareness.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Step 1: Research and Positioning (Weeks 1-2)</h2>
        <p>Before any announcement, understand Hong Kong's media ecosystem. Identify tier-1 journalists and outlets that cover your industry. Research competitor launches. Understand the regulatory environment and any trade associations that might amplify your message.</p>
        <p>Position your product not as a "new thing," but as a solution to a problem Hong Kong cares about right now. Is it addressing affordability? Sustainability? Innovation? Local pride? Frame your story around one of these themes.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Step 2: Secure Pre-Launch Media Exclusives (Weeks 2-3)</h2>
        <p>Offer exclusive previews to 2-3 top-tier journalists or outlets. This creates early coverage momentum and gives flagship media a reason to prioritise your story. Pre-launch coverage builds anticipation and credibility before your official announcement.</p>
        <p>Give them real story: the problem you're solving, why you chose Hong Kong, the innovation behind the product. Not just "we're launching something cool."</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Step 3: Plan Your Launch Event (Weeks 2-4)</h2>
        <p>A product launch event in Hong Kong should be experiential, not just transactional. Journalists should experience your product, not just hear about it. Include influencers, early customers, and industry voices who can amplify the story through their networks.</p>
        <p>Location matters. Choose a venue that reflects your brand positioning. Partner with a co-host if it strengthens your credibility (e.g., tech partner, industry body).</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Step 4: Build Your Media List (Week 2)</h2>
        <p>Don't just pitch everyone. Create a tiered approach:</p>
        <p><strong>Tier 1 (Priority outreach):</strong> Business, tech and lifestyle journalists with significant following in your category.</p>
        <p><strong>Tier 2 (General outreach):</strong> Broader business media, regional correspondents.</p>
        <p><strong>Tier 3 (Follow-up):</strong> Industry-specific outlets, bloggers with relevant audiences.</p>
        <p>Personalise invitations to Tier 1 and 2. Generic mass emails get deleted.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Step 5: Craft Your Media Narrative (Week 3)</h2>
        <p>Your story should answer: Why now? Why Hong Kong? Who benefits? What's different?</p>
        <p>Develop three versions: a headline (one sentence), a pitch (one paragraph), and a full story (three paragraphs). Use the same core narrative across all channels—consistency builds credibility.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Step 6: Launch Communications (Day 1)</h2>
        <p>Your launch day should coordinate three channels:</p>
        <p><strong>Press releases:</strong> Distribute via major wire services and direct to your media list. Follow up immediately with calls or emails to key contacts.</p>
        <p><strong>Social media:</strong> Announce across all platforms. Use behind-the-scenes content and customer testimonials, not just product shots.</p>
        <p><strong>Email:</strong> Alert your customer base. They're your first advocates. Make it easy for them to share.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Step 7: Work the Room at Your Event (Launch Date)</h2>
        <p>Have your founders or key spokespeople available for media interviews. Brief them on key messages and prepare them for tough questions. Media time should be unstructured and conversational—not scripted presentations.</p>
        <p>Capture everything: photography, video, customer reactions. This content becomes your social media and PR assets for weeks afterward.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Step 8: Secure Follow-Up Coverage (Weeks 2-3 Post-Launch)</h2>
        <p>The launch event generates immediate coverage, but sustained visibility comes from follow-up stories. Pitch journalists on angles they didn't cover at launch: customer stories, supply chain innovation, market impact, competitive differentiation.</p>
        <p>Offer yourself as a source for broader industry stories. As the new player, you're newsworthy in emerging trends discussions.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Step 9: Measure and Iterate (Ongoing)</h2>
        <p>Track media coverage (reach, tone, message pull-through), website traffic and conversion metrics from launch period, social media engagement and sentiment, and actual sales impact attributed to coverage.</p>
        <p>What worked? What fell flat? Apply these lessons to your next product announcement or campaign.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
        <p>Hong Kong's media landscape responds to authentic storytelling, local relevance, and genuine relationship-building. Avoid generic launches. Be specific about why your product matters to Hong Kong. Give journalists real stories, not marketing spin. Coordinate across channels to amplify every announcement. The difference between a successful launch and a forgotten one is usually attention to these fundamentals.</p>

      <section>
        <h2>Events vs Discounts—Why Experiences Win</h2>
        <p>In a market saturated with promotional discounts and digital ads, events stand out. They create moments people remember. They generate stories journalists want to tell. They build emotional connections that discounts never will.</p>
        <p>But events only deliver business results when they're paired with deliberate media strategy. An event with no PR is just an expensive gathering. An event with strategic PR becomes a campaign that multiplies your reach far beyond the room.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Pre-Event: Build Anticipation Through Media</h2>
        <p><strong>4-6 weeks before:</strong> Begin pitching journalists on the "why" behind your event. Don't promote attendance—pitch the story. What trend does your event illuminate? What conversation does it spark? Why should journalists care?</p>
        <p>Offer exclusive interviews with your speaker or founder. Provide background materials that help journalists understand the context. Position yourself as a thought leader, not an event promoter.</p>
        <p><strong>2-3 weeks before:</strong> Release a media advisory and press release. Use this to lock in reporter attendance. Include details on what attendees will learn, who's speaking, and why it matters to Hong Kong.</p>
        <p><strong>1 week before:</strong> Follow up with key journalists personally. Offer interview slots with your CEO or expert speaker. Make it easy for them to attend and cover your story.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>During Event: Create Coverage Moments</h2>
        <p>Design your event with media coverage in mind. This doesn't mean stage-managed artificiality—it means creating genuine moments worth capturing.</p>
        <p><strong>Hire a photographer and videographer:</strong> Capture candid moments, speaker highlights, attendee reactions. This content becomes your social media and website assets for months.</p>
        <p><strong>Create a media room:</strong> Provide a quiet space for interviews. Have your speakers available on a schedule. Make journalists' jobs easier and they'll spend more time covering your event.</p>
        <p><strong>Live-tweet and social media:</strong> Share real-time insights, speaker quotes, attendee reactions. Use a branded hashtag. This extends your reach beyond the physical room and creates a digital narrative around your event.</p>
        <p><strong>Prepare sound bites:</strong> Brief your speakers on quotable insights. Journalists are looking for powerful quotes, not corporate jargon. "The future is..." quotes are always covered.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Post-Event: Extend Coverage Through Follow-Up</h2>
        <p><strong>Day 1 after:</strong> Send thank you notes to attending journalists. Include event photos and video highlights. Offer follow-up interviews with speakers or attendees for deeper stories.</p>
        <p><strong>Week 1 after:</strong> Release a recap story with key findings, attendance figures, and attendee quotes. This gives journalists a news peg for follow-up coverage. Journalists who didn't attend now have a reason to report on your event.</p>
        <p><strong>Weeks 2-4 after:</strong> Pitch journalists on the "implications" of your event. How did attendee feedback reveal market trends? What did speaker insights mean for your industry? Position attendee stories as thought leadership.</p>
        <p><strong>Ongoing:</strong> Repurpose event content across your owned channels. Video highlights become social content. Speaker insights become blog posts. Attendee testimonials become case studies. One event becomes months of content.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Why This Matters</h2>
        <p>An event generates immediate attendee impact. But strategic media coverage multiplies that impact to include people who never attended. A 200-person event with 10 media placements reaches tens of thousands. That's the power of event + PR strategy.</p>

    excerpt: 'Thought leadership isn\'t just for B2B. Learn how to position your executives or spokespeople as trusted voices in your industry through media interviews and strategic positioning.',
    content: `
      <section>
        <h2>Why In-House Teams Should Partner with Event Management Agencies</h2>
        <p>Thought leadership isn't about self-promotion. It's about becoming the expert people turn to when they need insight, analysis, or perspective on industry trends.</p>
        <p>For brands in Hong Kong, thought leadership is particularly powerful. It differentiates you from competitors. It builds trust faster than advertising ever could. It gives journalists a reason to call you for comment on industry news.</p>
        <p>But building thought leadership requires strategy. It's not automatic. It takes deliberate positioning, consistent visibility, and authentic expertise.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Position Your Expert</h2>
        <p>Start by identifying who should be your thought leader. Is it your founder? Your CMO? Your Chief Innovation Officer? Choose someone who has genuine expertise, is articulate in interviews, and is willing to invest time in visibility.</p>
        <p>Define their area of expertise. Don't be generic. "Marketing" is too broad. "Direct-to-consumer marketing in Hong Kong's luxury segment" is positioning. The more specific, the more credible and memorable your positioning becomes.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Get Them Published</h2>
        <p>Bylined articles in credible publications are the foundation of thought leadership. Your expert should be writing:</p>
        <p><strong>Op-eds and opinion pieces</strong> in major business publications (South China Morning Post, Hong Kong Economic Times). Pitch editors on emerging trends your expert can comment on, not on your company.</p>
        <p><strong>Industry expert columns</strong> in trade publications. Many industry publications actively seek external contributor columns. Regular placement builds visibility within your target market.</p>
        <p><strong>LinkedIn articles</strong> for broader reach. LinkedIn articles have longevity—they get discovered and shared for months after publication. Use them to share insights from your bylined publications.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Secure Media Commentary</h2>
        <p>Journalists constantly need expert commentary for articles they're writing. Become the expert they call.</p>
        <p><strong>Get on journalist distribution lists:</strong> Use services like ProfNet or contact journalists directly. Let them know what topics your expert can comment on, and make yourself available on quick turnaround.</p>
        <p><strong>Be a reliable source:</strong> When a journalist calls, respond quickly (within 2 hours if possible). Provide quotable, substantive insights. Never refuse an interview. Each interview builds your credibility and makes them more likely to call again.</p>
        <p><strong>Pitch as a source:</strong> Don't wait for journalists to call. When you see an industry story being covered, email relevant journalists with your expert's perspective. "I saw your article on... Our CEO has additional insight on... Would your readers benefit from this perspective?"</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Speak at Industry Events</h2>
        <p>Speaking at conferences, seminars, and industry panels positions your expert as an authority. Journalists often cover major events and interview speakers. Your speech becomes media content.</p>
        <p>Target events where your target audience attends. Quality over quantity—one speaking slot at a prestigious conference is worth more than five at smaller events.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Build Your Online Presence</h2>
        <p>Your expert should maintain a professional social media presence (especially LinkedIn). Share insights regularly. Engage thoughtfully with industry conversations. Post about your published articles and media appearances.</p>
        <p>This isn't about self-promotion. It's about visibility and demonstrating consistent expertise over time.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Measure Your Progress</h2>
        <p>Track media mentions and bylined articles. Monitor which journalists are citing your expert. Watch for unsolicited interview requests. These are signals that your thought leadership positioning is working.</p>
        <p>True thought leadership takes 6-12 months to establish, but the business impact—inbound leads, partnership inquiries, media credibility—is substantial and long-lasting.</p>

      <section>
        <h2>How NGOs Can Use Media Relations to Build Community Support</h2>
        <p>NGOs operate in a unique communication environment. You're competing for attention with well-funded corporate campaigns. You're building trust with donors and community members. You're trying to drive social change, not just sell a product.</p>
        <p>Media relations is one of the most powerful tools NGOs have. It's cost-effective (unlike paid advertising). It carries the credibility of third-party validation. It reaches people who might never visit your website.</p>
        <p>But media relations for NGOs requires different strategies than corporate PR. Journalists care about impact, not profits. Donors care about authenticity, not spin. Community members care about results, not promises.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Tell Stories, Not Statistics</h2>
        <p>An NGO that says "We helped 500 beneficiaries this year" is less compelling than an NGO that tells the story of one person's transformation through your program.</p>
        <p>Journalists are looking for human stories. Donors want to know their money creates real impact. Communities respond to authenticity.</p>
        <p>Identify program beneficiaries willing to share their stories. Work with them to develop a compelling narrative: what problem did they face? How did your organisation help? What changed for them? This becomes your media story.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Build Relationships with Journalists Covering Your Issue</h2>
        <p>Don't just pitch when you have news. Identify journalists covering your issue area (environment, education, social welfare, health). Engage with their work. Comment thoughtfully. Share their articles. Build a relationship before you need media coverage.</p>
        <p>When journalists know your organisation as credible and responsive, they're more likely to cover your stories.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Make Journalists' Jobs Easy</h2>
        <p>Respond quickly to interview requests. Provide clear, jargon-free talking points. Be honest about limitations or challenges. NGOs that talk candidly about what they don't know yet build more trust than those that oversell their impact.</p>
        <p>Provide access to beneficiaries (with their consent) and program leaders. Let journalists see your work firsthand. A site visit is worth more than a hundred pitch emails.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Partner with Community Influencers</h2>
        <p>Community leaders, religious figures, local politicians, and respected community members have credibility media coverage can amplify. Involve them in your programs. Get their endorsement. Media coverage of their involvement multiplies your reach.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Create News Opportunities</h2>
        <p>Look for moments that create natural news hooks:</p>
        <p><strong>Milestone anniversaries:</strong> "NGO celebrates 10 years helping homeless youth"</p>
        <p><strong>New program launches:</strong> "New mental health initiative targets rural communities"</p>
        <p><strong>Research findings:</strong> Partner with universities to research your issue area. Findings become media stories.</p>
        <p><strong>Policy advocacy:</strong> When government is debating your issue, your organisation should be quoted. Be proactive in offering expertise.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Leverage Social Media and Owned Channels</h2>
        <p>Media coverage is powerful, but it's not the only channel. Use your website, email, and social media to tell your story directly to your community and supporters.</p>
        <p>Share beneficiary stories, program updates, impact metrics, and success stories. This builds community engagement and gives journalists content to reference in their coverage.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Measure Your Impact</h2>
        <p>Track media coverage (reach, tone, message accuracy). Monitor awareness and support among your target community. Track donations and volunteer inquiries. Which media coverage drove actual engagement or donations?</p>
        <p>This helps you refine your media strategy over time.</p>

      <section>
        <h2>Storytelling in Beauty and Cultural Marketing</h2>
        <p>Cultural organisations face a unique challenge: How do you build audiences and secure funding while maintaining artistic integrity?</p>
        <p>The answer is strategic PR that tells compelling stories about your work, your artists, and your impact. Not corporate marketing. Authentic storytelling that helps audiences understand why your work matters.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Tell the Story Behind the Exhibition</h2>
        <p>Every exhibition or performance has a story beyond the work itself. Why did you choose these artists? What conversation does this work spark? How is it relevant to Hong Kong right now?</p>
        <p>That's your media story. It's not "come see beautiful art." It's "why this art matters, and why you should care."</p>
        <p>Work with your curators to develop a compelling narrative around each exhibition or program. This becomes the foundation of your PR and marketing.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Develop Relationships with Arts and Culture Journalists</h2>
        <p>Hong Kong has journalists who specialise in arts, culture, and lifestyle coverage. Build relationships with them:</p>
        <p>Invite them to private previews. Give them early access to exciting exhibitions. Make them part of your story development process, not just a distribution channel for finished announcements.</p>
        <p>When journalists feel invested in your work, they become advocates, not just reporters.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Create Interview Opportunities</h2>
        <p>Artists, curators, and directors are more interesting interview subjects than institutional spokespeople. Make them available for media interviews.</p>
        <p>Brief them on key messages (why this work matters, what they want audiences to know), but let them speak authentically. Journalists value genuine artist voices over institutional talking points.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Tie Your Work to Broader Conversations</h2>
        <p>Cultural organisations that only talk about their own exhibitions are less newsworthy than those that tie their work to broader conversations:</p>
        <p><strong>Diversity in the arts:</strong> Are your exhibitions featuring underrepresented artists?</p>
        <p><strong>Arts accessibility:</strong> How are you making culture accessible to all of Hong Kong?</p>
        <p><strong>Artist support:</strong> How do you support emerging or mid-career artists?</p>
        <p><strong>Cultural preservation:</strong> How does your work preserve Hong Kong's cultural heritage?</p>
        <p>When journalists see your organisation as part of larger cultural conversations, you become more newsworthy.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Leverage Social Media for Community Building</h2>
        <p>Social media is particularly powerful for cultural organisations. Behind-the-scenes content, artist interviews, exhibition previews—these drive community engagement and give journalists content to reference.</p>
        <p>Use social media to build dialogue with your audience, not just broadcast announcements.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Partner with Educational Institutions and Communities</h2>
        <p>Educational programs, community workshops, and youth initiatives create story opportunities. "How a new exhibition is teaching Hong Kong's next generation about contemporary art" is a media story.</p>
        <p>These partnerships also expand your audience and build community support, which journalists covering culture always find compelling.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Measure Your Success</h2>
        <p>Track media coverage and reach. Monitor attendance during and after media coverage. Track social media engagement and community participation. Track funding and sponsorship inquiries.</p>
        <p>Cultural PR is about building long-term audience support, not short-term ticket sales. Measure accordingly.</p>

    excerpt: 'Social content alone isn\'t enough. The most successful brands connect their social strategy with earned media, events and consistent messaging for compounded impact.',
    content: `
      <section>
        <h2>Social Media and Earned Media Work Together</h2>
        <p>Many organisations treat social media as separate from PR. They post on Instagram and Twitter, but their social strategy doesn't connect to their broader media and communications strategy.</p>
        <p>This is a missed opportunity. When social media and PR work together, each channel amplifies the other. Media coverage drives social conversation. Social engagement creates PR moments. The result is compounded reach and influence.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>How Social Media Amplifies PR</h2>
        <p><strong>Real-time sharing:</strong> When you secure media coverage, share it immediately on social media. Tag journalists and outlets. Add context about why this coverage matters. Your social audience becomes aware of your media wins.</p>
        <p><strong>Journalist outreach:</strong> Follow journalists who cover your industry. Engage thoughtfully with their work. When you have news, these journalists are more likely to cover you if they already know you on social media.</p>
        <p><strong>Interview clips:</strong> When executives are interviewed by media, share clips on social media. Short, quotable segments perform well. You extend the reach of media coverage to your social audience.</p>
        <p><strong>Community conversation:</strong> Social media lets you respond in real-time to media coverage and industry conversations. Engage authentically. Build your expertise and thought leadership in front of your audience.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>How PR Amplifies Social Media</h2>
        <p><strong>Media coverage creates social moments:</strong> A press mention or feature story gives your followers something newsworthy to share and discuss.</p>
        <p><strong>Journalist mentions drive traffic:</strong> When journalists mention you on their social channels, their audiences visit yours. Media credibility translates into social following growth.</p>
        <p><strong>Events create content:</strong> Press coverage of your events, activations, and announcements gives you authentic content for social media. You're sharing third-party validation, not just self-promotion.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Create an Integrated Content Strategy</h2>
        <p>Your content should work across channels:</p>
        <p><strong>One central message:</strong> Whether you're talking to media, social media, or your website, the core message is consistent. Different channels adapt the message to their audience, but the fundamentals stay the same.</p>
        <p><strong>Shared content calendar:</strong> Your PR team and social media team should work from one calendar. When you're launching a media campaign, your social team is amplifying with relevant content. When you have a social media moment, your PR team is pitching it to journalists.</p>
        <p><strong>Content multiplication:</strong> Create content once, use it across channels. A behind-the-scenes video can be on social media, can be shared with journalists, can be repurposed into a blog post, can be featured on your website. Maximise the ROI of every piece of content you create.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Measure Integrated Impact</h2>
        <p>Track not just social media metrics, but cross-channel impact:</p>
        <p>Did media coverage drive social media engagement? Did social media conversation attract journalist attention? Did your social following grow after media coverage? Which content assets drove the most cross-channel engagement?</p>
        <p>Understanding these connections helps you refine your integrated strategy over time.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
        <p>Social media is most powerful when it's not isolated. Connect it to your broader PR and communications strategy. Let media coverage amplify your social content. Let social engagement create PR opportunities. When all channels work together toward one goal, the impact multiplies.</p>
