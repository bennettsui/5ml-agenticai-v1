          <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-8 leading-relaxed">
            Audiences trust recommendations from people they follow more than traditional advertising. Influencer partnerships leverage this trust—amplifying your brand message through authentic voices in channels where your customers spend time. The best influencer campaigns don't feel like ads; they feel like genuine recommendations from friends, which is why they drive higher engagement, awareness, and conversion than most paid channels.

We vet creator partnerships, check audience authenticity, and ensure values alignment. This takes time, which is why we recommend starting with 8–12 weeks of lead time for campaign planning."
