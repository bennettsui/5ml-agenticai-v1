================================================================================
KEY RESEARCH FINDINGS
================================================================================

FINDING 1: Combinations Trump Individual Stars
- Hong Luan alone = good for romance
- Tian Xi alone = good for joy
- Hong Luan + Tian Xi together = PERFECT romantic indicator
- Implementation: Always analyze pairs, not singles

FINDING 2: Void Stars Have Reverse Mechanics
- Normal: Auspicious stars = good, Malevolent = bad
- Void stars: Auspicious stars with voids = fortune falls through
- Void stars: Malevolent stars with voids = harm is reduced
- Key phrase: "見吉化凶，見凶化吉"
- Implementation: Needs special algorithm handling

FINDING 3: Secondary Stars Are Not Minor
- Grade B stars (乙級) significantly enhance/modify main stars
- Some secondary stars have major effects in luck cycles
- Critical for accurate chart interpretation
- Implementation: Cannot skip secondary star analysis

FINDING 4: Modern Context Required
- Traditional meanings (官爵、品級 - official ranks) still valid
- Contemporary equivalents more relevant (job promotion, recognition)
- Both interpretations should be offered to users
- Implementation: Dual interpretation in UI

FINDING 5: Research Gaps Identified
- 月照 (Yuezhao) needs deeper research
- 天梟 (Tianjiao) needs Wang Ting Zhi school consultation
- Identified but documented as incomplete
- Recommendation: Phase 2 research using identified sources

================================================================================
